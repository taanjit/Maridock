       "**SCOPE OF WORK / INSTRUCTIONS**\n",
       "\n",
       "**Pre-requisites**\n",
       "Ensure the main engine is in a safe and stable condition for measurement and alignment. Remove any debris, oil, or residue from the engine bed and crankshaft surface.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Measurement of Crankshaft Deflection**\n",
       "Use a crankshaft deflection measurement gauge to measure the deflection at multiple points along the crankshaft. Take note of the measurements and calculate the mean deflection value.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Calculation of Alignment Values**\n",
       "Using the measured deflection values, calculate the required alignment values to ensure proper crankshaft alignment. Consult the manufacturer's instructions and relevant regulatory requirements for guidance.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Adjustment of Crankshaft to Desired Alignment**\n",
       "Using the calculated alignment values, adjust the crankshaft to the desired alignment. This may involve adjusting the engine bed, main bearings, or other components.\n",
